## 2026-07-02 — password as collection defaultVisibility rejected

Pending Allen's ratification: `password` is rejected as a collection
`defaultVisibility`. The SPEC Domain model types the four-value visibility union
on `Page.visibility`; `Collection.defaultVisibility` is not explicitly typed.
Password visibility requires per-page server-generated material: the one-time
password response and stored argon2 hash from REQ-PUB-005. Collection-level
inheritance cannot supply that material, including retroactively when patching a
collection default would flip existing unset pages into password-with-no-hash.
The coherent fail-closed reading is that collection defaults range over
`default | public | private`, while `password` is page-explicit only.
